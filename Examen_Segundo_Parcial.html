              <hr>
              <p class="text-center">The iterative design is a design methodology based on a cyclic process of prototyping testing. Based on testing the result of the most recent iteration. This process improve by far the quality and functionality of desing. Changes are easiest and less expensive to implement in the earliest stages of development. The first step in the iterative design process is to develop a prototype, it works by going little by litle until we end up with a good project and relevant feedback</p>

              <p class="text-center">Its easy, we are people, we love helping others and when you do the things you love you ignite a flame that makes you give motre than necessary to the project in this case, No More Hunger. We are friends doing something we love and we are trying to do it right. this is the passion, we are doing this to fulfil our thrist of the injustice in this world helping those who need it the most.

              Our action is reflected in the development of our web page. We are trying to structure our ideas as clear and atractive as possible, so the user can feel comfortable using our site and giving us possitive feedback.

              By starting the idea showing that everything is possible it's a great start. We will start by recolecting signatures that show the people's support to our iniciative.

              As knowledge we can say that we are not the only ones worried about this problem. We know a country who did this, Italy just approved a law that helps the country fighting against hunger and nutritional problems of the society. That means a bright future to our project, means that people actually cares about this huge problem and we just need to find a way to implement it here on Mexico </p>

              <hr>
              <p align="left">
              Step 1: Start a Brainstorm (You need to define a idea, and to do that you need a lot of ideas)<br>
              Step 2: Define an idea(you need to focus on one to make it grow, you can come back and choose other if the first one fails)<br>
              Step 3: How you make it come to life (Make a plan, always work following a plan)<br>
              Step 4: Search people that have the same passion and ask them to join (Working alone is hard, you need a team to help you improve)Step 5: By working in group start to think in a prototype(You need somethign that exist something real, make a prototype and show it to people).<br>
              Step 6: Find a way to implement the idea (Used the prototype to get feed back)<br>
              Step 7: Start to get to the people who can help you grow (Get people interest and sponsorship or maybe someone to make publicity of your idea).<br>
              Step 8: With all the feed back start to grow.(Use the information from your users  to grow)<br>
              Step 9: Define stages in your project and every stage improve by feedback.(keep growing)<br>
              Step10: Launch your idea(Make it real, launch it to the world. and remember, always use feed back)</p>

              Right now we are making our full efford to make our web page atractive and functional in order to achieve this we dedicate a few hours a week to make this possible.
              Our results have been amazing, the web page it's almost ready and we are a few lines of code and some publicity ahead to reach our goals. This is clear and you can consult it anytime if you access to our web page. That is why we would say we are 100 % commited to this project. </p>
